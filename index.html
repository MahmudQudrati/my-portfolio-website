        <p>
          You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But
          nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and
          mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
          Development Hero.

            goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics. I can build
            any simple but gorgeous website.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.They liked it. And uploaded the content.
